                <p>Data driven stories must attempt to cater to their audiences. The designers who oversee these data driven stories must take into consideration the audience’s knowledge about data visualisations. It is, however, difficult to find this information about the audience, but even considering them broadly greatly aids in the design process (Riche, 2018:212). </p>
                <p>A way to ensure that audience members understand the data that is being delivered to them through data visualisations is annotations. Annotations add explanations and explain context which could be helpful for those who are not as familiar with certain types of diagrams, charts, and graphs. When done correctly annotations should not get in the way of the experienced viewer’s interpretations (Riche, 2018:214). Annotations explain what the content means as well as how to read the visualisation (Riche, 2018:215). </p>
                <p>The audience depends on the publication, those who read finance news probably understand finance, and those who read easy reading magazines are often just reading because they are bored or are trying to pass time. It is important to take this into consideration when deciding what data to include or how to visualise it (Riche, 2018:217). </p>
                <p>Many people who are experienced with working with data, are not necessarily experienced with communicating that data. It is important to be consistent when communicating data. Consistency with font, colour, and level of interactivity. This helps the audience better understand what the producer is trying to tell them. Designers must also note that design elements are different in different countries, such as in those where viewers read from left to right (Riche, 2018:220).</p>
                <p>One must question what the audience needs in the context that the data driven story is being presented. Are they trying to stay informed about certain topics? Are they trying to find out more about themselves or others? Are they engaging to connect with others? Are they doing it for entertainment purposes? The answers to these questions can help shape the way that the data-driven story is designed (Riche, 2018:222). </p>
                <p>Maps are a good visualisation to use as many viewers are familiar with them. They are also able to pick their city to see certain data about it, making it feel more personalised (Riche, 2018:223).</p>
                <p>A tactic one could use to make data driven stories more interactive is by asking the audience questions. The Reponses can then be visualised as well. Asking questions can also aid in the viewers comprehension (Riche, 2018:224).</p>
                <p>When making a data visualisation interactive one must keep in mind that when the reader must click, something great must happen to keep them intrigued. One must also not hide any important information from the viewers, if it is important put it somewhere where the viewers will see it clearly and that getting interactions to work on all platforms is tricky and expensive (Riche, 2018:227).</p>
                <p>In conclusion, there is much to consider when making data driven stories communicate something specific to audience members. </p>
