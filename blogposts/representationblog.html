                <p>This blog post aims to explain what J. Kidd means by Representation: Representation and Reality, Representation and Myth, Representation and Visual Culture, Representation as Persuasion and Representation and Identity Politics (Kidd, 2015:18).</p>
                <p>Representation is everywhere around us; it helps to shape the way in which we see the world, our cultures, our identities, and our communities (Kidd, 2015:19).</p>
                <p>Representation and Reality – Reality in media is constructed using signs and codes. Signs refer to the words, images sound or gestures used of which meaning is derived by the audience members (Kidd, 2015:19) There is no connection between the sign (such as a word) and the thing that the sign describes, it is us, as human beings who give meaning to the signs. According to Saussurean theory the signifier and the signified must come together to give us the sign. Signs only have value due to their differences to other signs (Kidd, 2015:21). For example, we only know that the word ‘dog’ means because we can differentiate it from the word ‘bird’ or ‘lamp’. Signs are grouped into codes such as genre codes for example. Kidd (2015:22) suggests that the codes and signs that we choose to represent us matters and that it is important for future generations to understand codes and signs in a way that helps them identify key differences between things such as a news report and an advertisement. It is also important for us to think about the meanings we create from signs and codes within our own contexts. Are we being prejudice? Are the meanings we create not necessarily the whole truth?</p>
                <p>Representation and Myth – Denotations and Connotations in signs play a part in the myths that we create about our world (Kidd, 2015:23). At a denotative level the logo of McDonald’s is just an M, but at a Connotative level a myth is created, about the food McDonald’s serves, about its role in capitalism, about the way it affects obesity rates or about it being a favoured late night after party meal. It depends on the context in which a person views McDonalds. The context will determine what the myth is that is being created when viewing the logo. The issue with these myths is that they are often so naturalised that we do not even recognise them as myths anymore (Kidd, 2015:24). Myths, such as those about the ‘Orient’ which is a western discourse about The Middle East is very representationally problematic as it leads into ‘Othering’(Kidd, 2015:25) and does not tell the whole story about a group of people, but rather tells a false narrative that often stereotypes a whole people. ‘Othering’ is done in media in subtle and unsubtle ways (Kidd, 2015:26).</p>
                <p>Representation and Visual Culture – Visual communication is more open ended and interpretive than other forms of communication (Kidd, 2015:26). Images that are more abstract have more connotations than those that are not. Whether an image is meant to be viewed solely by its connotations or denotations is reliant on the context in which the image is being used. To get their point across, those who made the image must use connotations that audience members will be familiar with (Kidd, 2015:27). To read an image one must ask themselves under which circumstances was the image produced? For what purpose was the image produced? What is the historical context of the image? (Kidd, 2015:27). What is its context within other images if it comes in a set? (Kidd, 2015:28). The same can be done for data visualisation stories. It is important to remember that images do not tell the truth, nor are they objective. These days (2020 and onwards) photographs and images can be altered to tell a story (Kidd, 2015:30). Data visualisation has become widely used in media but sometimes these visualisations are overused and can make it difficult for viewers to retain the information that is being given to them (Kidd, 2015:30). The way these data visualisations are used can spill over into persuasion, if for example, if one uses data that shows their campaign in a positive light, it could persuade voters to vote for them. The data may not show the full story, however. </p>
                <p>Representation as Persuasion – Advertising is everywhere, they can be memorable and shape the way we live, just as other representations can (Kidd, 2015:32). It is often the more subtle advertisements that get us to buy what it is trying to sell, through the associations that is being made the consumers fill in the rest (Kidd, 2015:33). When seeing advertisements, we must ask ourselves what is the advert trying to sell? How is it trying to make us feel? What advertising tactics are used? And Which groups are being represented? (Kidd, 2015:35).</p>
                <p>Representation and Identity Politics – Social order is constructed through media representation, Kidd (2015:36) argues that things that are political can never be neutral. When representations refer to race, class, gender, age, disability, and sexual orientation they are often problematic as it usually favours white middle class hetero-normative males. Representations of groups of people are always changing (Kidd, 2015:38) those representations that were acceptable before may change and become unacceptable when we become more aware of social issues. </p>
                <p>In conclusion representations are greatly responsible for the way that we view the world around us, the groups of people that surround us, the way in which we choose to consume things and make decisions. </p>
