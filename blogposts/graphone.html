            <article class="blogwriting">
               <p>The graph that I decided to build with JavaScript using D3 and the covid19 Api as well as the World Bank Api is a bubble plot. I used statistics of Total Covid19 cases in countries together with statistics of total GDP of the countries per person and related those with the death rates of those countries.</p>
               <p>To get the death rate I divided the total amount of Covid19 related deaths in the countries with the total amount of confirmed cases to get a decimal. </p>
               <p>As one can see on the graph it seems as though countries with a higher GDP have more Covid19 related deaths but those with a lower GDP have a higher risk of infection. This data is still, however, in its early stages but if I were to also include the statistics of population density or mean ages of the population of the countries, the results would be able to tell us much more. </p>
               <p>What did I learn through the making of this graph? I spent about 5 hours in total on the code. Theoretically it should have taken a shorter amount of time if I was more confident in my abilities with JavaScript but I am fairly new to the language. I learnt a lot about the syntax of JS through this experience and how to problem solve. Some issues that I came across was that the country list was in a different order on the World Bank API than on the Covid19 API. In order to fix that I had to check that the country codes matched before adding the GDP values as if I didnâ€™t the wrong GDP would show for the wrong countries. This is the code I used for that: </p>
               <P>if(cleanData[j].cc == gdpData[1][index].country.id){
                cleanData[j].gdp = gdpData[1][index].value;
</P>
                <p>I am not yet sure how to add the descriptors for x and y axis through JavaScript but that would be my next step for making this graph more readable, as well as writing out the values of the increments in a more readable manner. </p>
