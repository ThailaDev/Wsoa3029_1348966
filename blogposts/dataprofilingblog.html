            <article class="blogwriting">
                <p>There are many algorithms in this world, some of which can identify human behavior and possibly our thought patterns. These algorithms map out an average of everyone that it algorithmizes an ‘average you’ in a process called data profiling (Janssens, 2016:61). </p>
                <p>Data profiling runs the risk of reducing human beings to a simple set of data. This also brings up the risk of ‘othering’ those who cannot be profiled. Some like to believe that people cannot be reduced to such statistics and that we cannot be bound by any system (Janssens, 2016:61). </p>
                <p>We are currently experiencing an era of hyper connectedness. Many people are connected to the web in more than one way, be that on laptops, tablets, phones, or even smart fridges. Being so connected allows algorithms to collect a lot of data about these connected individuals (Janssens, 2016:61). Companies must follow ethical laws and guidelines when collecting data, but unfortunately these laws and guidelines are changed so often that they are not always properly enforced. We are never explicitly warned that our every move on the web is tracked and that that data is stored. Companies can use and sell this data about us to other companies, without our knowledge (Janssens, 2016:62).</p>
                <p>This kind of data profiling, can, however, be valuable to us. For example, doctors can take into account the ‘average you’ and use that data to treat us more accurately. However, the question of whether we have any input about the data that is used from us remains. Some believe that a human checker needs to be present, as if the data is wrong for someone who may find themselves in trouble with the law, then they might be wrongly accused or let go (Janssens, 2016:63).</p>
                <p>There are some theories that one day our DNA can be analysed and can predict many things about an individual. This is known as DNA profiling. Currently, it is not possible, but it is possible for systems to give us individual data profiles. This data can change the way we view people and their social positions (Janssens, 2016:64).</p>
                <p>We must make sure to not place too much responsibility on this data that is collected from us. It is not always accurate. An important question is: Are humans just a biological being, or are we more than that (Janssens, 2016:64)? </p>
                <p>To conclude in the era of Hyper connectedness, one must be aware that data is constantly being captured about us. We must also be aware that this data is not always accurate. </p>
