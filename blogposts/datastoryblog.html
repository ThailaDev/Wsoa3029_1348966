                <p>This blog post aims to outline how to be ethical when creating Data Driven Narratives.</p>
                <p>Even though data driven graphics in the news sphere has been used for a few hundred years we have yet to receive a set of ethical standards to use them responsibly that has been adopted by the wider public (Riche, 2018:234). Ethics refers to moral standards of behaviour within a professional field.  </p>
                <p>The ethical principals that have been proposed are as follows: </p>
                <p>Transparency – This is relevant to data driven stories because those who make the data driven stories must be transparent about how they arrived at their preferred interpretation of the data (Riche, 2018:234,235).</p>
                <p>Truth seeking and reporting it as fully as possible – this is important within the sphere of data visualisation as there are many opportunities to mislead and misinform audiences of these data driven stories (Riche, 2018:234,235). </p>
                <p>Engaging with the community as an end rather than a means – Those who are presented in the data must be respected and treated ethically. They must not just be used to tell a story. Designers can engage with the community rather than just dictating the data at them (Riche, 2018:234,235). </p>
                <p>Where does the data come from? What was the data intended to do? Why was the data collected? Is the data complete? These are important question when trying to find data that tells informative and truthful data stories. One must also source the data legally and must cite where the data is from for the data narrative to be ethical (Riche, 2018:236).</p>
                <p>It is easy for data to be ‘rinsed and washed’. It is important to ask how the world was measured and turned into data. One must know the definitions of what exactly is being tracked and how those definitions could be misrepresented or misunderstood (Riche, 2018:237).</p>
                <p>One must use population-normalized maps when displaying data else it will just show the density of populations in certain areas. To do this one must divide by the population in the area that is being mapped (Riche, 2018:238). One can put the responsibility of normalising on the end user. Different methods of normalising result in a different data driven narrative being told by the data (Riche, 2018:239).</p>
                <p>Ethical aggregation is important. One must be consistent of how they aggregate data within a single data set (such as using the mean or median) (Riche, 2018:239). </p>
                <p>When using more sophisticated software algorithms to predict and collect user data one must keep in mind that errors can be made which will affect the story (Riche, 2018:240). To negate the effects of the inaccuracies they must be made transparent to users (Riche, 2018:241).</p>
                <p>Filtering is an important process which eliminates useless data and only keeps the relevant information, but this could lead to cherry picking the data. It is therefore important to consider ethics during this process as it could easily lead to misinterpretation (Riche, 2018:241).</p>
                <p>It is ethically necessary to keep the anonymity of those that are used to collect data. No identifying information should be given in any data driven narrative (Riche, 2018:242).</p>
                <p>One must also keep in mind the spacing of numerical representation. It is something that can easily mislead viewers. The spacing must be consistent throughout the visualisation (Riche, 2018:242). It is also important not to put different data which does not actually have a relationship on the same graph as it implies a relationship that is not actually there (Riche, 2018:244).</p>
                <p>Annotations give context to what is being visually represented. It is important to provide relevant context that does not distract from or cause the viewer to misinterpret the data. </p>
                <p>When the data is interactive and viewers can filter results it is ethically important to make sure the defaults are well researched and accurate (Riche, 2018:246).</p>
